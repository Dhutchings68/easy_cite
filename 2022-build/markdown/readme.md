## About 

This build uses the parsedown php library to convert markdown into html in real time. 

This intends to create a robust template and easy to edit referencing documents.

# How?

The Parsedown.php file is a single file compiler https://parsedown.org/

The index.php calls markdown files and arranges them as html.

Needs a PHP environment to run - pretty sure emedia servers have that

# To do

* Write all referencing styles as Markdown pages
* create a bootstrap 5 template for the RMIT library
* Apply theme
* test
* upload
