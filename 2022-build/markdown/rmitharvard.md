**This is a guide only**. Please confirm the referencing requirements for your course with your lecturer.
RMIT Harvard is an author-date referencing style. It is based on the Referencing and attribution section of the [Australian Government Style Manual (AGSM)](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/) released in 2021.

RMIT Harvard style requires in-text references and a reference list. **In-text references** appear within the body of the document. They include the author’s family name or name of the organisation responsible for the information source and the year of publication, with page numbers required for quotes if available. **A reference list** provides the full bibliographic details of all in-text references at the end of the assignment.
It is recommended that you read the general rules for each section before looking at the specific information about the source you need to reference.

**Note:** Although the AGSM states that title of online sources should be hyperlinked for electronic formats, RMIT Harvard style does not do this because hyperlinks are not compatible with the EndNote program and other referencing software. In addition, the links would not be available when the work is printed.

### General rules for in-text references

###### start-subtype-content

Use in-text references to acknowledge all authors or sources of information (print or online) used within your writing, either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.

**Paraphrasing** is when you express the author’s ideas in your own words. Paraphrasing is generally preferred to quotes as they show you understand and can explain the ideas you have read rather than simply copying them.

**A direct quote** is when you use the exact words from the original source. Use quotes sparingly, such as when the exact words of the author are important to the claim you are making. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks). Include a page number in the in-text reference if available.

In-text references include the author’s family name (or company or organisation name, if the author is a company or organisation) and year of publication, with page numbers (if available) required for quotes.

An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence. When you are referencing information that authors/researchers agree about, the reference is placed at the end of the sentence (an information prominent citation). This is the most common type of in-text reference. Referencing at the beginning of a sentence (author prominent citation) is used to focus on a particular author/researcher’s point of view or on specific research that might not apply in all situations.

If the author is integrated as part of the sentence, the date (and page number for direct quote) is placed in parentheses immediately after the author's name.

When a work has two authors, always list both authors’ names every time the reference occurs.

When a work has three or more authors, list the first author’s name followed by et al. For example, Haslam et al. (2021) or (Haslam et al. 2021).

For **pen names and pseudonyms**, use the name adopted by the author, e.g. … (Mari 2009), Quynh Huong (2020) inspires … In the reference list, list according the pen name or pseudonym and include the author’s actual in parentheses if known.

If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

If the publication date is unknown, use n.d.

If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then place c. (meaning 'circa' or about) before the year.


###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item


###### start-subtype-item

### Secondary citations

###### start-subtype-content

**Secondary citations** acknowledge the work of an author you refer to in your assignment that you read about in someone else’s work. Where possible, try to use the original source.

For example, if you use Vanna’s ideas which you read about an article by Martin and Rodríguez, you would only need to show who the ideas belong to and also where you read about them.  

  > Previous research appears to indicate ... (Vanna, cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021).

  > Vanna (cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021) suggests that ...

In the examples, the ideas/information belong to Vanna, but you paraphrased them from your reading of Martin and Rodriguez’s work.
In the reference list, include the source you read. For this example, you would only need to put Martin and Rodríguez in the reference list.


###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item


###### start-subtype-item

### Multiple citations in same parentheses

###### start-subtype-content

For multiple citations in the same parentheses, list all citations chronologically, separated by a semi-colon (;) for example:

  > It has been claimed that ... (Ghezzi and Cavallo 2018; Jocevski 2020; Soluk et al. 2021).

For multiple works by the same author in the same year, insert a letter after the year, starting with the letter ‘a’ for the first work you cite. In the reference list, include the same letter after each year of publication.

  > It is argued that ... (Ayoob 2021a, 2021b).

  > Ayoob (2021a, 2021b) states that ...

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item


###### start-subtype-item

### Works by different authors with same family name

###### start-subtype-content

Some works have **different authors with the same family name**. To identify their works, insert the initial(s) of all the first authors’ given names in the in-text references. In the reference list, order their works by the year of publication.

  > It is argued that ... (Peterson M 2019), but others claim that ... (Peterson JR et al. 2021).

###### end-subtype-content

###### start-subtype-item

### Changing the wording of a quote

###### start-subtype-content

If you **change the wording of a quote**, follow the steps below to ensure that you do not to change the meaning of the original text:

- Use an **ellipsis** which consists of three dots (…) if you leave out any part of the original text.

- If you want to add words to the original text (e.g. to integrate the grammar or make the information clearer), you must put them in **square brackets** \[ \].

- With direct quotes, always use the spelling and formatting style of the original source.

- If the source contains grammatical or spelling errors, you must copy the quote exactly as it appears in the original source (including the errors). Then put sic in parentheses **(sic)** immediately after the error.


###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Block quotations

###### start-subtype-content

**Block quotations** are quotes of more than 30 words. Block quotes do not use inverted commas. They are signalled with a colon and the quote begins on a new line that is indented from the margin and can be set in smaller text size.

As Smithers (2020:57) points out:

  > Paraphrasing and synthesising information shows deeper understanding of your reading and research than simply using direct quotes. It enables you to demonstrate your insight into the concepts and thus obtain higher marks in your assignment.

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

- Use a reference list at the end of the document to include the publication details of all the in-text references cited within your writing.

- The general order of the elements is:
    - author or authoring organisation’s name
    - publishing date
    - title information
    - publisher details
    - accessed date and URL for digital content

- Start a reference list on a new page using the heading **References**.

- List only references cited in your writing.

- If your lecturer/teacher or supervisor has also requested a bibliography, list any other sources that you have read but not included in your writing under a heading of **Bibliography**.

- The reference list is arranged alphabetically by the family name of the **author**. If the author of a reference is a company or organisation, list the reference based on the first letter of the company or organisation name.

- When the shortened form or acronym of an organisation’s name is mentioned in your work, use it in your references. List the short form, then include the full name in parentheses.

- If there are multiple entries by the same author, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.

- If there are multiple entries by the same author in the same year, add ‘a’ after the first work, ‘b’ after the second and so on.

- If there are several authors with the same family name, then arrange alphabetically by initials.

- If the author used a **pseudonym or pen name**, list that name in the author position. If the actual name is known, place it in parentheses after the pen name. e.g. Mari (Maria Giovanna Colli)

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If the publication **date** of a reference is unknown, use n.d.

- If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text then write c. (meaning 'circa’ or approximately) before the year.

- If you have used a **secondary citation**, include only the source you read in your reference list. For example, if you read an article by Martin and Rodriguez and you use some information from Vanna that was mentioned in the article, you would only list Martin and Rodriguez in the reference list.

- If there is no **place of publication** use n.p. (for ‘no place’).

- If the place of publication (city name) is not commonly known (e.g. Harlow) or the place of publication could be in two or more countries, put the country name after the city. For example, Harlow, England.

- If citing a **PDF**, link to the page where the PDF is hosted not the PDF link.

- If the publication has a **DOI** (digital object identifier), include it in the reference list, at the end of the citation using the short form ‘doi’ in lower case, e.g.

    > Zufferey C, Yu N and Hand T (2020) ‘Researching home in social work’, *Qualitative Social Work*, 19(5-6):1095-1110, doi:10.1177/1473325019880244.

- If the work is in a language other than English, put the title in the original language followed by the English translation, e.g.
*Gabrielle Chanel. Manifeste de Mode (Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion Manifesto)*.

### E-book

###### start-subtype-content

#### In-text reference

**Paraphrases**

  > In 1970, fighting relentless police discrimination, and feeling let down by the current legal system, together with law students and lawyers, Aboriginal activists established the first Legal Aboriginal Service in Redfern (Perheentupa 2020).

  > Shann (1948) provides a history of Australia's agricultural economy at the time of Governor Phillip.

**Direct quotes**

Page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original document. If no page number is available, you can include information about the location the quote is from in your writing.

The first example below comes from an e-book that has a page number, i.e. 35. The second example does not have page numbers:

  > ‘The first Legal Aboriginal Service was founded in response to persistent police discrimination and the legal system’s failure to curtail it’ (Perheentupa 2020:35).

  > Shann (1948) argues in the opening paragraphs of Chapter 1 that 'neither legal restrictions nor isolation made the "settlers from convicts" better able to read the riddle of agriculture in a climate fruitful at times but fatally capricious'.


#### Reference list

After publisher name, include the DOI (Digital object identifier) in lower case, followed by a full stop, if e-book has one. You will often find this within the inside of the cover page. No need to include place of publication if you include a DOI. If there is no DOI, include place of publication (city) instead. As books are published in editions, you do not need to include the date you accessed it online.

### General rules for websites and webpage documents

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

#### In-text reference

- An entire website is only cited if you are referring to its content or purpose in general, or if you cannot link the information to a particular webpage.

- For example, when referring to a website as a general resource in your assignment, you should link to that website homepage in the reference list. However, if you cite specific content from a particular webpage on the website, you need to identify the specific webpage in your reference list.

- Include the author’s name (individual or corporate), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

- If a webpage does not have an author name (individual or organisation), use the title of the webpage in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author’s name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text citations if the organisation uses it regularly, e.g. ‘WHO’ not ‘World Health Organization’. This saves you space.

#### Reference list

- When referring to a website as a general resource in your assignment, you should link to that website homepage in the reference list. However, if you cite specific content from a particular webpage on the website, you need to identify the specific webpage in your reference list.

- The author can be an individual person or organisation.

- Enclose publication year (e.g. 2021) in brackets after author. If no publication year supplied, write n.d. (for ‘no date’) or c. (about) if you can estimate the date from information on the site.

- If a webpage or downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name start the reference with the title of the webpage or webpage document in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author’s name is an organisation and you have used the abbreviated (shortened name) form in your in-text citations (e.g. WHO), include both the abbreviated (shortened name) form followed by the full version name in brackets, e.g. WHO (World Health Organization).

- Reference specific webpages rather than a whole website; pinpoint the specific location of information.

- If you need to include the organisation’s homepage in the reference list, and the homepage does not have a title, put 'Homepage' instead of a title. Do not italicise, e.g. Telstra (n.d.), Homepage, Telstra, accessed 13 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.telstra.com.au/

- Include the word website after the name of the website. But if the name of the website is a URL (e.g. vic.gov.au), do not write the word website. Do not italicise the name of website.

### General rules for artworks

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

RMIT Harvard includes the following within the definition of an artwork:

- drawings, paintings, prints, sculpture and ceramics
- photographs
- posters and cartoons
- performance and ephemeral art
- digital works
- antiquities
- maps

Artworks that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

When citing works of art in the text of your assignment, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

  1. within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
  2. in the figure layout (caption).

Citations are also influenced by where you sourced the creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than copies from a reproduction.

How you capture and include the artwork or image (e.g. screen shot, photograph, copy-and-paste) does not influence the way in which it is referenced. Cite the work based on where you sourced the work.

Note: Your lecturer may have specific requirements for referencing artworks. Any directions given by your lecturer must be followed, even if they differ from this guide.

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Captions

###### start-subtype-content

Captions are used to provide a description of the artworks you use. These are usually placed below the illustration.

A figure number is used in the caption to identify each illustration. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear and followed by a colon.

Illustrations you create of your own work are not usually referenced. However, a caption such as ‘Figure 7: Photograph by author’ or ‘Figure 11: Initial sketches’ might be appropriate when other illustrations in your assignment are referenced. Check your lecturer’s requirements.

Make sure you refer to the figure in your writing and include the figure number. This can be in the sentence or in parentheses, for example (see Figure 1).

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the figure above or below or on page 3.

Your lecturer might require a specific long or short caption style. Whichever style you use, make sure you apply it consistently.

##### Captions (Own work)

**Rule**

  > Figure number: Description or explanation

**Examples**

  > Figure 1: Author’s photograph

  > Figure 2: Initial sketches of the design

##### Short captions for reproduced works

If the image was on a website include the URL, otherwise provide the in-text referencing details as described in other areas of this guide.

**Rule**

  > Figure number: Artist’s full name (year produced) *Title of artwork* [medium], Name of museum/gallery, Location of museum/gallery or Publishing details of where image was sourced.

**Examples**

Maps taken from an online source can include:

- digitised maps that originate from a print source such as old maps and are made available in an electronic format by museums, galleries and libraries
- web maps that use satellite imagery and GPS data and are taken from online navigation and mapping sites such as Google Maps

When citing maps in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:  

- within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference
- in the figure layout (caption)

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the figure above or below or on page 3.

### Tables and diagrams

###### start-subtype-content

When citing tables, graphs or other diagrams in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:  

- within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference
- in the table/figure layout (caption)

Label tables sequentially as Table 1, Table 2 and so on, followed by a colon. Other graphs and diagrams are labelled as Figures.  

Include a title that describes or explains the information in the table or diagram. Note, this is not italicised.

Refer to a table or figure by its assigned number, not as the table or figure above or below or on page 3.

For tables, graphs and diagrams using published content, acknowledge the source below the table/figure number and title, on a new line.

#### Tables (your own work)

When the information is your own work based on data you have collected independently, for example, from your own research or experiments, label your table with a number and give a title to the work. Use standard font (no italics).

**Example**

  > Table 1: Comparison of results from groups A, B and C

#### Tables (adapted from published material)

If you are using information gathered from published information but are presenting it in a table or figure that you have created, acknowledge the source as you would for paraphrased information in a caption.

When the table includes data from more than one source, you must cite all sources you relied on to create the table.

**Rule**

  > Figure number: Title of table
  Source: adapted from Publishing details of where the information was sourced

**Examples**

  > Table 2: Reason why students plagiarise
  Source: adapted from Bretag B, et al. 2020

  > Table 3: Fluctuation in imports 2010 to 2020
  Source: adapted from Mitchelton 2018; ABS 2019; DFAT 2020

#### Tables (reproduced from published material)

If you are using a table or graph that has been published elsewhere, acknowledge the source and provide the same details you would for quoted information.

**Rule**

  > Figure number: Title of table
  Source: Publishing details of where the information was sourced

**Examples**

  > Table 4: Prison demographics in Australia
  Source: AIHW 2018:1

  > Figure 10: Buy Now, Pay Later Payments in Australia
  Source: Fisher, Holland and West 2021:61

#### In-text reference

  > Bretag et al. (2020) identified a number of factors that contributed to plagiarism as listed in Table 2.

  > Fluctuations in the imports over the last decade are represented in Table 3.

  > Table 4 highlights current prison demographics in Australia, based on data compiled by AIHW (2018).

#### Reference list

Reference tables and diagrams in accordance with the source they appear in. For example, if the table or diagram appears in a book or journal article, you reference the book or journal article. Please refer to the relevant section(s) within this guide for how to reference the various sources.

**Examples**

  > IAHW (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare) (2018) ‘5.7 Prisoners’ *Australia’s health 2018’, Australia’s health series no. 1, catalogue number AUS 221*, IAHW, Australian Government, accessed 13 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/0f15de30-8575-4e80-ac9d-5560633635e0/aihw-aus-221-chapter-5-7.pdf.aspx

**Paraphrase**

  > Rasmussen and Ngwenya (2021) argue that a successful blended learning environment requires that students are adequately supported.

**Direct quote**

  > 'Students should engage in critical self-reflection regarding their ability to apply the theory they study to their future employment' (Rasmussen and Ngwenya 2021:76).

#### Reference list

**Conference paper / presentation**

Enclose the title of the conference paper in single inverted commas (quotation marks) and write the name of the conference in italics.

A conference paper from a webpage will generally be sourced from either the conference's website or the host organisation’s website.

**Conference paper from a webpage**

If the document is in PDF format, avoid direct links to the actual PDF – instead link to the page that hosts the PDF. Do NOT write the word website.

Add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

  **Rule**

  > Author’s family name Initial (Day Month Year of conference) ‘Title of paper: subtitle of paper’ [conference presentation], *Name of Conference*, Conference host, Place of conference, accessed Day Month Year. URL

  **Example**

### Lecture notes or course material

###### start-subtype-content

#### In-text reference
Materials from your course may include lecture notes, PowerPoint slides or presentations and micro-credentials. Where possible, try to get the information from a published source.

Note: Some courses and lecturers might not accept lecture materials as a reference in assignments.

**Paraphrases**

  > Campbell (2022) asserts that prosperity and sustainability need not be mutually exclusive.

  > The impact of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on promoting economic growth ... (Blakewell 2022).

**Direct quote**

  > The emphasis in week 3’s lecture on the 'cultural and social background of employees as an important step in managing workplace diversity' (Tran 2022) led me to reflect on my own experiences in human resource management.

### Legal material

###### start-subtype-content

#### In-text reference
Take care to give accurate and complete details about legislation and legal cases.

When discussing government policies and services that require you to refer to the relevant law(s), the title of legislation is generally placed first, followed by the relevant subsections.

The name of the Act is written in italics.

The jurisdiction should also be identified, either in the sentence or after the name of the Act, in parenthesis as an abbreviation in standard font without full stops, for example:

  > The Victorian government’s introduction of the Wage Theft Act 2020 was a response to …

  > Multiple jurisdictions have laws pertaining to the management of water supply in the Murray-Darling Basin, including the Water Act 1989 (Vic), Natural Resources Management Act 2004 (SA) and Water Act 2007 (Cth).

Depending on the context, you might need to refer to specific sections, paragraphs and subparagraphs using a pinpoint reference.

The units are written in lower case unless they begin a sentence. Units of an Act can be written in long or abbreviated form. Do not begin sentences with the abbreviated form.

The **Australian Government Style Manual**[https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material] provides more detail and examples regarding the use of legal materials.

**Paraphrases**

  > Section 5A of the *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic) outlines the principles for compliance with child safety standards.

  > The principles for compliance with child safety standards are outlined in the *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic), s 5A.

  > Reportable matters under the Act are an acknowledgement that ‘the protection of children is the paramount consideration in the context of child abuse’ (para 16B(1)(b)).

  > Section 55 of the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) states that ‘there is a guarantee that the goods are reasonably fit for any disclosed purpose, and for any purpose for which the supplier represents that they are reasonably fit'.

For a legal case, party names are italicised.

Law report series are abbreviated, and the first page of the case should appear after the series details.

With quotes, include the location of the quote using a page number. To specify a page number, use the word 'at' rather than p.

**Paraphrase**

  > The case examined the company’s failure to exercise reasonable care in using aluminium composite panels in the construction of an apartment tower (Owners Corporation No.1 of PS613436T v LU Simon Builders Pty Ltd (Building and Property) [2019] VCAT 286).

**Direct quote**

  > It was identified that ‘…’ (*Beasley v Francis* (2008) 237 CLR 1 at 72-8).


#### Reference list

The title of a legal case, legislation or patent should be italicised.

### Student’s own work (previously submitted)

###### start-subtype-content

#### In-text reference

You should include scholarly sources in your assignments to adhere to best practice in academic integrity. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Referencing your own work is necessary to make sure you don’t self-plagiarise.

If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author.

Don’t cut-and-paste sentences or paragraphs from previous assignment. If you are reusing your ideas, reword them (paraphrase) and take care to contextualise them to your new assignment.

**Note:** Check with your lecturer or teacher if it is permissible to reuse and cite work you have previously submitted.

**Paraphrases**

When paraphrasing, include your family name and the year when you previously submitted the work.

For example, if Jane Smith wanted to use her ideas from a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2021, her in-text reference may look like this:

   > An interview with a marketing manager at a leading women’s fashion retailer revealed that … (Smith 2021).

   > Smith (2021) previously found that …

If your original assignment contained critique or commentary about other sources that you base your ideas on in your new assignment, you should also include those citations in your new assignment.

If Jane’s earlier paper had criticised Presley and Dietrich for example, and her new work might look like this:

  > According to Smith (2021), the claims of Priestly and Dietrich (2009) are out-dated and do not apply to the case currently being examined.

  > I have not included Priestly and Dietrich’s (2009) model in this analysis because I believe their claims are not relevant to current work practices (Smith 2021).

**Direct quote**

For a direct quote, place the quote between single quotation marks and also provide the page number from the previous work.

  > 'Risk taking behaviours align with certain personality traits or disorders' (Smith 2021:13).

#### Reference list

You should include scholarly sources in your assignments to adhere to best practice in academic integrity. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Check with your lecturer or teacher if it is permissible to reuse and cite work you have previously submitted in other courses.

Referencing your own work is necessary to make sure you don not self-plagiarise.

If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.

**Rule**

  > Student family name Initial (Year) ‘Title of previous work’ [Unpublished paper for course code], Institution name, Location (if not inferred by university name).

**Example**

  > Smith J (2021) ‘An analysis of personality theory’ [Unpublished paper for HRHR1001], RMIT University, Melbourne.

**Direct quote**

  > Khoo (2018:44) argues that 'the idea of service design challenges the aesthetics of interiors due to its focus on functionality and efficiency rather than creating a liveable and appealing environment’.

#### Reference list

**Thesis viewed online on an institutional repository**

Theses and dissertations are mostly cited and referenced like books. Rather than italics, titles of thesis are enclosed in single inverted commas (quotation marks).

Add the abbreviated name of the award (for example, PhD thesis) in square brackets and the University name followed by the place of publication.

For theses and dissertations accessed online, include the database or URL. In parentheses, include any identification number supplied by the database.

  **Rule**

  > Author’s family name Initial (year) ‘Title: subtitle’ [Thesis type], University, URL or Database name (Document identifier).

  **Example**

  > Court T (2019) ‘The site re-presented: everyday civic landscapes’ [PhD dissertation], RMIT University, RMIT Research Repository (9921864000901341).

  **Print Thesis**

For a print thesis, provide the author's family name and initial(s) followed by the year.

Include the title of the thesis enclosed in single inverted commas (quotation marks) but not italicised.

Add the abbreviated name of the award (for example, PhD thesis) in square brackets and the University name followed by the place of publication (if not inferred by the University name).

  **Rule**

  > Author’s family name Initial (year) ‘Title: subtitle’ [Thesis type], University, Location.

### Interview

###### start-subtype-content

Face-to-face interviews that you conduct yourself are considered personal communication and are, therefore, not included in the reference list.

Published interviews follow the same rules as the source that the published interview appears in. For example, if the interview appears in a television program or podcast, you reference the television program or podcast. Please refer to the relevant section(s) within this guide for how to reference the various sources.

The person cited in the in-text reference is treated as the author since they have primary responsibility for communicating the content you are referring to.

**Example**

  > Nabben K (16 June 2021) ‘*The Business: cryptocurrency special*’ [streaming video], *ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)*, ABC iview, accessed 30 November 2021, https<nolink>://iview.abc.net.au/video/NS2157H001S00

### Personal communication

###### start-subtype-content

#### In-text reference

Personal communication, such as face-to-face interviews, conversations, telephone calls, letters or emails, is only cited an in-text reference.

Information about personal communication must be included in the in-text reference. Include the type of personal communication (for example, personal conversation, email, interview, telephone conversation) and the date in a date month year format.

Personal communication is not published and therefore, unavailable for verification so is not included in the reference list.

**Paraphrase**

  > Ms Merrick, Melville Shire Council CEO, confirmed the accuracy of the claims by email on 25 April 2022.

**Direct quotes**

  > My field placement supervisor commented ‘…’ (Lee, personal communication, 14 May 2022).

  > Rowlands (personal communication, 20 February 2022) stated …
