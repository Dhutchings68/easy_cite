**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

- Please confirm the referencing requirements for your course with your lecturer.

- Use the *Referencing and attribution* section of the <a href="https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/" target="_blank">Australian Government Style Manual (AGSM)</a> (opens in a new tab) released in 2021 to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.

RMIT Harvard is an author-date referencing style.

RMIT Harvard style requires in-text references and the reference list.

**In-text references** appear within the body of the document. They include the author’s family name or name of the organisation responsible for the information source and the year of publication, with page numbers required for quotes if available.

**A reference list** provides the full bibliographic details of all in-text references at the end of the assignment.

**Note:** Although the AGSM states that the title of online sources should be hyperlinked for electronic formats, RMIT Harvard style does not do this because hyperlinked titles are not compatible with the EndNote program. In addition, the links would not be available when the work is printed.

### General rules for in-text references

###### start-subtype-content

- Use in-text references to acknowledge each author or source of information (print or online) used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.  
    
    **Paraphrasing** is when you express the author’s ideas in your own words. Paraphrasing is generally preferred to quotes as they show you understand and can explain the ideas you have read rather than simply copying them.
    
    **A direct quote** is when you use the exact words from the original source. Use quotes sparingly, such as when the exact words of the author are important to the claim you are making. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks). Include a page number in the in-text reference if available.
    
    In-text references include the author’s family name (or company or organisation name, if the author is a company or organisation) and year of publication, with page numbers (if available) required for quotes.
    
- An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence. When you are referencing information that authors/researchers agree about, the reference is placed at the end of the sentence (an information prominent citation). This is the most common type of in-text reference. Referencing at the beginning of a sentence (author prominent citation) is used to focus on a particular author/researcher’s point of view or on specific research that might not apply in all situations.

- If the author is integrated as part of the sentence, the date (and page number for direct quote) is placed in parentheses immediately after the author's name.

- When a work has two authors, always list both authors’ names every time the reference occurs. Use the full word **and** when listing the authors in parentheses. For example: (Hill and Martinez-Diez 2020). Also use the full word **and** when mentioning the authors in a sentence. For example: Hill and Martinez-Diez (2020)... .

- When a work has three or more authors, list the first author’s name followed by et al. For example, Haslam et al. (2021) or (Haslam et al. 2021).

- For **pen names and pseudonyms**, use the name adopted by the author, e.g. ...(Mari 2009), Quynh Huong (2020) inspires... In the reference list, list according to the pen name or pseudonym and include the author’s actual name in parentheses if known.

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If the publication date is unknown, use **n.d.** (for 'no date').

- If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then place **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) before the year.

- **Secondary citations** acknowledge the work of an author you refer to in your assignment that you read about in someone else’s work. Where possible, try to use the original source.  
    
    For example, if you use Vanna’s ideas which you read about an article by Martin and Rodríguez, you would only need to show who the ideas belong to and also where you read about them.
    
    > Previous research appears to indicate ... (Vanna, cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021).
    
    > Vanna (cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021) suggests that...
    
    In the examples, the ideas/information belong to Vanna, but you paraphrased them from your reading of Martin and Rodriguez’s work.
    
    In the reference list, include the source you read. For this example, you would only need to put Martin and Rodríguez in the reference list.
    
- For **multiple citations in the same parentheses**, list all citations chronologically, separated by a semi-colon (;) for example:  
    
    > It has been claimed that ... (Ghezzi and Cavallo 2018; Jocevski 2020; Soluk et al. 2021).
    
- For **multiple works by the same author in the same year**, insert a letter after the year, starting with the letter ‘a’ for the first work you cite. In the reference list, include the same letter after each year of publication.  
    
    > It is argued that ... (Ayoob 2021a, 2021b).
    
    > Ayoob (2021a, 2021b) states that...
    
- Some works have **different first authors with the same family name**. To identify their works, insert the initial(s) of all the first authors’ given names in the in-text references. In the reference list, order their works by the year of publication.  
    
    > It is argued that ... (Peterson M 2019), but others claim that... (Peterson JR et al. 2021).
    

#### Direct quote

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s).

Do not overuse direct quotes.

Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

If you **change the wording of a quote**, follow the steps below to ensure that you do not change the meaning of the original text:

- Use an **ellipsis** which consists of three dots (...) if you leave out any part of the original text.

- If you want to add words to the original text (e.g. to integrate the grammar or make the information clearer), you must put them in **square brackets** \[ \].

With direct quotes, always use the spelling and formatting style of the original source.

If the source contains grammatical or spelling errors, you must copy the quote exactly as it appears in the original source (including the errors). Then put sic in parentheses **(sic)** immediately after the error.

A quote in an in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

> Day (2018:3) states that 'writing is a uniquely powerful, precise and satisfying form of expression. It is also a vital skill for future employment'.

##### Middle of a sentence

> In the introduction to their study of consumer purchasing preferences, Liang et al. (2021:163) observe that 'the Internet of Things (IoT), especially smart home technology, has been rapidly advancing and has finally reached mainstream markets and user segments'.

##### End of a sentence

> 'Building plans tend to ignore climate risks in most instances' (Hill and Martinez-Diez 2020:18).

#### Block quotations

Block quotations are quotes of more than 30 words.

Block quotes do not use inverted commas. They are signalled with a colon, and the quote begins on a new line that is indented from the margin and can be set in smaller text size.

As Smithers (2020:57) points out:

> Paraphrasing and synthesising information shows deeper understanding of your reading and research than simply using direct quotes. It enables you to demonstrate your insight into the concepts and thus obtain higher marks in your assignment.

#### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

Paraphrasing in an in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

> Fiorineschi and Rotini (2021) explain that the design discipline commonly recognises novelty as an important factor in assessing creativity.

##### Middle of a sentence

> Using daily rainfall datasets, the Bureau of Meteorology (2022) highlights...

##### End of a sentence

> The Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) program aims to develop students’ professional self and enable them to build and reinvent their practice (Papadopoulou 2020).

### Multiple works by the same author(s) in the same year

###### start-subtype-content

Identify works by the same author in the same year by inserting a letter after the year, starting with the letter ‘a’ for the first work you cite, e.g. 2021a, 2021b. In the reference list, include the same letter after each year of publication.

#### In-text reference

> It is argued that...(Ayoob 2021a, 2021b).

> Ayoob (2021a, 2021b) states that...

#### Reference list entry

> Ayoob M (2021a) *How much change will the end of the Netanyahu era bring?*, Australian Strategic Policy Institute: The Strategist website, accessed 9 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.aspistrategist.org.au/how-much-change-will-the-end-of-the-netanyahu-era-bring/

### Referencing works by different first authors with the same family name

###### start-subtype-content

To identify the works of different first authors with the same family name, insert the initial(s) of all the first authors’ given names in the in-text references. In the reference list, order their works by the year of publication.

#### In-text reference

> It is argued that...(Peterson M 2019), but others claim that...(Peterson JR et al. 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, order the works of each author by the year of publication. For this example, since Peterson M published their work in 2019 and Peterson JR in 2021, you need to list the Peterson M (2019) reference **before** that of Peterson JR (2021).

###### end-subtype-content

###### start-subtype-item

### Multiple references in the same parentheses

###### start-subtype-content

When including two or more references in the same parentheses in a sentence, list all citations chronologically, separated by a semi-colon (;).

#### In-text reference

> It has been claimed that...(Ghezzi and Cavallo 2018; Jocevski 2020; Soluk et al. 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, include the sources you referenced in the parentheses.

### Secondary citation

###### start-subtype-content

Secondary citations acknowledge the work of an author you refer to in your writing that you have read about in someone else’s work. Where possible, try to use the original source.

For example, if you use Vanna’s ideas which you read about an article by Martin and Rodríguez, you would only need to show who the ideas belong to and also where you read about them.

#### In-text reference

> Previous research appears to indicate... (Vanna, cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021).

> Vanna (cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021) suggests that...

In the examples, the ideas/information belong to Vanna, but you paraphrased them from your reading of Martin and Rodriguez’s work.

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, include the source you read. For this example, you would **only** need to put the Martin and Rodríguez (2021) reference.

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

- Use a reference list at the end of the document to include the publication details of all the in-text references cited within your writing.

- The general order of the elements is:
    - author or authoring organisation’s name
    - publishing date
    - title information
    - publisher details
    - accessed date and URL for digital content

- Start a reference list on a new page using the heading **References**.

- List only references cited in your writing.

- If your lecturer/teacher or supervisor has also requested a bibliography, list any other sources that you have read but not included in your writing under a heading of **Bibliography**.

- The reference list is arranged alphabetically by the family name of the **author**. If the author of a reference is a company or organisation, list the reference based on the first letter of the company or organisation name.

- When the shortened form or acronym of an organisation’s name is mentioned in your work, use it in your references. List the short form, then include the full name in parentheses.

- If there are **multiple entries by the same author**, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.

- If there are **multiple entries by the same author in the same year**, add ‘a’ after the first work, ‘b’ after the second and so on.

- If there are **multiple different first authors with the same family name**, then arrange alphabetically by initial(s) of the first authors' given names.

- If the author used a **pseudonym or pen name**, list that name in the author position. If the actual name is known, place it in parentheses after the pen name, e.g. Mari (Maria Giovanna Colli).

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If the publication date of a reference is unknown, use **n.d.** (for 'no date').

- If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) before the year.

- If there is no place of publication, use **n.p.** (for 'no place').

- If the place of publication (city name) is not commonly known (e.g. Harlow) or the place of publication could be in two or more countries, put the country name after the city. For example, Harlow, England.

- If citing a **PDF**, link to the page where the PDF is hosted not the PDF link.

- If the publication has a **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier), include it in the reference list, at the end of the citation using the short form ‘doi’ in lower case, e.g. Zufferey C, Yu N and Hand T (2020) ‘Researching home in social work’, *Qualitative Social Work*, 19(5-6):1095-1110, doi:10.1177/1473325019880244.

- If the work is in a **language other than English**, put the title in the original language followed by the English translation, e.g. *Gabrielle Chanel. Manifeste de Mode (Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion Manifesto)*.

The first example below comes from a source that has a page number, i.e. 163. The second example does not have page numbers:

> In the introduction to their study of consumer purchasing preferences, Liang et al. (2021:163) observe that 'the Internet of Things (IoT), especially smart home technology, has been rapidly advancing and has finally reached mainstream markets and user segments'.

> 'The association between SSB \[sugar-sweetened beverages\] consumption and both endometrial and ovarian cancer risk tended to be positive but did not reach statistically significant levels' (Llaha et al. 2021).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Liang et al. (2021) claim that consumers, due to their beliefs about connectivity efficiency with the Internet of Things, display a high level of brand loyalty when purchasing smart devices and products for the home.

> Although Llaha et al. (2021) discovered that there is a correlation between drinking sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and developing endometrial and ovarian cancer, it was minor and insignificant.

### Website / webpage

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

An entire website is only cited if you are referring to its content or purpose in general, or if you cannot link the information to a particular webpage.

For example, when referring to a website as a general resource in your assignment, you should link to that website homepage in the reference list. However, if you cite specific content from a particular webpage on the website, you need to identify the specific webpage in your reference list.

The author can be an individual person or organisation.

Include the author's name (individual or corporate), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

If a webpage does not have an author name (individual or organisation), use the title of the webpage in italics, followed by year of publication.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. Websites or webpages, however, do not have page numbers. In this case, since no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The examples below come from sources that do not have page numbers:

> COVID-19 and climate change have had such a huge impact on the world that they both 'have exacerbated malnutrition in all its forms and threatened the sustainability and resilience of food systems around the world' (WHO 2021).

> Heath (2021) explains that artificial intelligence is seen as being 'tied to a system's ability to adapt and improvise in a new environment, to generalise its knowledge and apply it to unfamiliar scenarios'.

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Malnutrition, as well as the supply and provision of food worldwide, have worsened on account of COVID-19 and climate change (WHO 2021).

> Artificial intelligence can be defined as the capacity of a system to adapt to unfamiliar environments, forming generalisations in its knowledge and using that knowledge in new situations (Heath 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Enclose publication year (e.g. 2021) in brackets after author. If no publication year is supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If the year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the site, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) followed by the year.

- If a website/webpage or downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name, start the reference with the title of the webpage or webpage document in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author's name is an organisation and you have used the abbreviated (shortened name) form in your in-text citations (e.g. WHO), include both the abbreviated (shortened name) form followed by the full version name in brackets, e.g. WHO (World Health Organization).

- If an organisation's name is **both** the author of the website/webpage **and** the name of the website/webpage, use the abbreviated (shortened) form for the name of the website/webpage. Do this even if you have not used the abbreviated (shortened) form in your writing before. This avoid repetition of long names, e.g. DET website.

- Reference specific webpages rather than a whole website; pinpoint the specific location of information.

- If you need to include the organisation's homepage in the reference list, and the homepage does not have a title, put the word **Homepage** instead of a title. Do not italicise, e.g. Telstra (n.d.), Homepage, Telstra, accessed 13 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.telstra.com.au/

- Include the word **website** after the name of the website. But if the name of the website is a URL (e.g. vic.gov.au), do not write the word **website**. Do not italicise the name of website.

- After website/webpage name, add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021) followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

##### Rule

- If a website/webpage or downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name, start the reference with the title of the webpage or webpage document in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author's name is an organisation and you have used the abbreviated (shortened name) form in your in-text citations (e.g. WHO), include both the abbreviated (shortened name) form followed by the full version name in brackets, e.g. WHO (World Health Organization).

- If an organisation's name is **both** the author of the website/webpage **and** the name of the website/webpage, use the abbreviated (shortened) form for the name of the website/webpage. Do this even if you have not used the abbreviated (shortened) form in your writing before. This avoids repetition of long names, e.g. DET website.

- Include the word **website** after the name of the website. But if the name of the website is a URL (e.g. vic.gov.au), do not write the word **website**. Do not italicise the name of website.

- After website/webpage name, add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021) followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

- For downloadable webpage documents (e.g. PDFs), do not provide a URL that directly links to the document. Instead, provide a URL that links to the landing page where the document is located. If there is no landing page, provide a URL that directly links to the document.

##### Rule

### Social media post

###### start-subtype-content

For publicly accessible posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.

For social media accounts that are not publicly accessible (e.g. a private Facebook page), the social media post should be cited as personal communication, not as social media post.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. Social media posts, however, do not have page numbers. In this case, since no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

Cite the author's name (the poster) and the year of publication as you would for other reference types. Make sure, however, the reader knows that it is a social media post by mentioning the post type in the sentence.

> Following the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Greta Thunberg's tweeted that 'the people in power don't need conferences, treaties or agreements to start taking real climate action. They can start today'. (Thunberg 2021a).

> In Greta Thunberg's Instagram post, she asserts that 'we can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive' (Thunberg 2021b).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> In her Facebook post on 14 November, Thunberg (2021c) mocked world leaders for their lack of leadership at the COP26 summit in Glasgow by accusing them of all talk and no action.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Enclose the full publication date (e.g. 15 November 2021) in parentheses after the author or page name.

- Put title of the social media post in single inverted commas (quotation marks), followed by the type of post in square brackets, e.g. \[Facebook post\], \[Tweet\], \[Instagram post\].

- For social media posts with no title, include the first 10 words of content followed by an ellipsis (three dots). Put these first 10 words in single inverted commas (quotation marks).

- Include the page name where the post is located, after type of post.

- After post's page name, add accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021) followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

#### General rules for artworks

RMIT Harvard includes the following within the definition of an artwork:

- drawings, paintings, prints, sculpture and ceramics

- photographs

- posters and cartoons

- performance and ephemeral art

- digital works

- antiquities

- maps

Artworks that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

When citing works of art in the text of your assignment, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1.  within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
2.  in the figure layout (caption).

Citations are also influenced by where you sourced the creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than copies from a reproduction.

How you capture and include the artwork or image (e.g. screen shot, photograph, copy-and-paste) does not influence the way in which it is referenced. Cite the work based on where you sourced the work.

**Note:** Your lecturer may have specific requirements for referencing artworks. Any directions given by your lecturer must be followed, even if they differ from this guide.

#### Captions

Captions are used to provide a description of the artworks you use. These are usually placed below the illustration.

A figure number is used in the caption to identify each illustration. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear and followed by a colon.

Illustrations you create of your own work are not usually referenced. However, a caption such as 'Figure 7: Photograph by author' or 'Figure 11: Initial sketches' might be appropriate when other illustrations in your assignment are referenced. Check your lecturer's requirements.

Make sure you refer to the figure in your writing and include the figure number. This can be in the sentence or in parentheses, for example (see Figure 1).

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the figure above or below or on page 3.

**Note:**Your lecturer might require a specific long or short caption style. Whichever style you use, make sure you apply it consistently.

#### Captions (Own work)

##### Rule

> {.figure-text}Figure number: Description or explanation {/.figure-text}

##### Examples

> {.figure-text}Figure 1: Author’s photograph {/.figure-text}

> {.figure-text}Figure 2: Initial sketches of the design {/.figure-text}

#### Short captions for reproduced works

If the image was on a website include the URL, otherwise provide the in-text referencing details as described in other areas of this guide.

##### Rule

> {.figure-text}Figure number: Artist's full name (year produced) *Title of artwork* \[medium\], Name of museum/gallery, Location of museum/gallery or Publishing details of where image was sourced. {/.figure-text}

##### Examples

> {.figure-text}Figure 3: Artist unknown (11-12th C) *Tapestry with Dragons and Flowers* \[Silk tapestry\], The Metropolitan Museum of Art, https<nolink>://www.metmuseum.org/art/ collection/search/39733? {/.figure-text}

> {.figure-text}Figure 6: Untitled screenshot of Zelphr homepage {/.figure-text}

#### In-text reference to artworks

Italicise the titles of individual artworks, keeping any capitalisation, numbering or punctuation as specified by the artist.

Include the artist, year of creation and title of the artwork in parentheses, if not mentioned in the sentence, when first mentioning the work.

If you use an image, refer to the figure number when you discuss the artwork.

##### Examples

> The exhibition *Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion Manifesto* displays the Chanel's (1925) little black dress in silk organza transformed black from being the colour of mourning to the height of chic and modernity (see Figure 7).

> The purchase of Pollock's (1952) *Blue Poles* created great controversy regarding the value of abstract art when it was purchased for the National Gallery of Australia.

> As illustrated in Figure 4, the painting *Swanston Street from the Bridge* (Burn 1861) depicts Melbourne's growth into a city of domes and spires.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Your own unpublished work or artworks discussed without an image are not included in the reference list.

- Artworks viewed in person, such as at art galleries, museums and public spaces, are cited to acknowledge their influence on the development of your own ideas or work.

- Artworks that you reproduced from books, websites and other sources should be cited in the standard format of the source as described in the other sections of this guide.

- If viewed online: add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

- web maps that use satellite imagery and GPS data and are taken from online navigation and mapping sites such as Google Maps

When citing maps in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1.  within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
2.  in the figure layout (caption).

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the figure above or below or on page 3.

### Tables and diagrams

###### start-subtype-content

When citing tables, graphs or other diagrams in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1.  within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
2.  in the table/figure layout (caption).

Label tables sequentially as Table 1, Table 2 and so on, followed by a colon. Other graphs and diagrams are labelled as Figures.

Include a title that describes or explains the information in the table or diagram. Note, this is not italicised.

Refer to a table or figure by its assigned number, not as the table or figure above or below or on page 3.

For tables, graphs and diagrams using published content, acknowledge the source below the table/figure number and title, on a new line.

#### Tables (your own work)

When the information is your own work based on data you have collected independently, for example, from your own research or experiments, label your table with a number and give a title to the work. Use standard font (no italics).

##### Example

> Table 1: Comparison of results from groups A, B and C

#### Tables (adapted from published material)

If you are using information gathered from published information but are presenting it in a table or figure that you have created, acknowledge the source as you would for paraphrased information in a caption.

When the table includes data from more than one source, you must cite all sources you relied on to create the table.

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. If your previously submitted work has a page number, put a colon (:) after the year followed by the page number. If no page number is available and the quote comes from written work, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

> 'Risk taking behaviours align with certain personality traits or disorders' (Smith 2021:13).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> An interview with a marketing manager at a leading women's fashion retailer revealed that...(Smith 2021).

> Smith (2021) previously found that...

If your original assignment contained critique or commentary about other sources that you base your ideas on in your new assignment, you should also include those citations in your new assignment. For example, if you had criticised Presley and Dietrich in your earlier paper that you previously submitted, you might have something like this:

> According to Smith (2021), the claims of Priestly and Dietrich (2009) are out-dated and do not apply to the case currently being examined.

> I have not included Priestly and Dietrich’s (2009) model in this analysis because I believe their claims are not relevant to current work practices (Smith 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Put the title of your previous work in single inverted commas (quotation marks).

- Include type of work followed by the course code in square brackets: \[unpublished paper for course code\]. For example, \[unpublished paper for HRHR1001\].

- The location is the city of the University. Add only if it is not inferred by the University name.

##### Rule

> Student family name Initial (Year) 'Title of previous work' \[unpublished paper for course code\], Name of University, Location (if not inferred by university name).

##### Example

> Smith J (2021) 'An analysis of personality theory' \[unpublished paper for HRHR1001\], RMIT University, Melbourne.

### Interview

###### start-subtype-content

**Face-to-face interviews** that you conduct yourself are considered personal communication and are therefore not included in the reference list.

**Published interviews** follow the same rules as the source that the published interview appears in. For example, if the interview appears in a television program or podcast, you reference the television program or podcast. Please refer to the relevant section(s) within this guide for how to reference the various sources.

The person cited in the in-text reference is treated as the author since they have primary responsibility for communicating the content you are referring to.

#### Reference list entry

##### Example

> Nabben K (16 June 2021) 'The Business: cryptocurrency special' \[video\], *ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)*, ABC iview website, accessed 30 November 2021. https<nolink>://iview.abc.net.au/video/NS2157H001S00

### Media release

###### start-subtype-content

The author can be an individual person or organisation.

In your in-text references, include the author's name (individual or organisation), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'RBA' rather than 'Reserve Bank of Australia'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. If the media release has a page number, put a colon (:) after the year followed by the page number. If no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The example below comes from a source that does not have page numbers:

> In a recent media statement, the Minister for Housing acknowledged that 'young people leaving state care are at much higher risk of homelessness and unemployment' (Office of the Premier of Victoria 2021).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> The Minister for Housing announced additional funding for youth accommodation that would be integrated with additional support service (Office of the Premier of Victoria 2021).

> The Australian economy is now moving into a recovery phase, according to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Phillip Lowe (2021), following the disruptions caused by the Delta outbreak.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- After the author, put in brackets the day, month and year the media release was published.

- Italicise title of media release. Include type of source after title, i.e. \[media release\].

- Include the word **website** after website name.

- Add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

##### Rule

### Personal communication

###### start-subtype-content

Information about personal communication must be included in the in-text reference. Include the type of personal communication (for example, personal conversation, email, interview, telephone conversation) and the date in a date month year format.

Personal communication is not published and therefore unavailable for verification. For this reason, it is **not** included in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work.
