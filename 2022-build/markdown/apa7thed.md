Important: This is a guide only. To avoid losing marks:

- Confirm the referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer, and
Use the American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.). Opens in new window to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.
APA is an author-date referencing style. You need to follow this style when acknowledging your information sources.

- APA style requires that all references in a document are to be cited in-text, and that all in-text citations are compiled in a reference list at the end of the document. In-text citations appear within the body of the document and include details such as author(s) family name, year of publication, and page number(s) (if applicable). The reference list must provide full details of all in-text citations, and be arranged alphabetically by author.

### General rules for in-text citations

###### start-subtype-content

- When citing a work with a single author provide the author's family name and year of publication.

- When a work has two authors, always cite both family names every time the reference occurs in the text.

- When a work has three or more authors, cite only the family name of the first author followed by et al. and the year of publication.

- When using exact words that an author has used, you must enclose these in double quotation marks “ ” and supply an in-text citation, including page number(s).

- In your writing, you must acknowledge each author or source of information (whether print or online) either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.

#### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words. When paraphrasing, use round brackets to add the author(s) family name and the year of publication, or use the author(s) family name as part of your sentence, followed by the year of publication in round brackets.

*Note: When paraphrasing, the citation details can be used at the beginning, middle or end of the sentence.*

#### Citation at the beginning

> Brophy (2010) states that student motivation . . .

#### Citation in the middle

> . . . motivation is evident (Brophy, 2010), and as a result, can contribute significantly to achieving learning goals.

#### Citation at the end

> . . . where a number of subjective experiences can inform motivational outcomes (Brophy, 2010).

*Note: Citations can also be structured according to whether they give prominence to the author (narrative), or to the information being conveyed (parenthetical).*

#### Narrative citations

> In his research, Brophy (2010) argues that . . .

#### Parenthetical citations

> . . . findings are based on the qualitative study of behavioural learning (Brophy, 2010).

#### Including page numbers in a paraphrase citation

When paraphrasing, page numbers may also be included as part of the citation, especially if it helps the reader to locate the source of the information in a lengthy document.

*Note: Including page numbers when paraphrasing is optional and is **NOT** a requirement of the APA referencing style.*

> In order to establish a learning community in the classroom, it is important to motivate students by addressing both individual and collaborative learning goals (Brophy, 2010, pp. 23-24).

#### Direct quotes

Direct quotes are used when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between double quotation marks and add a page number. Do **NOT** overuse direct quotes.

> “Student motivation to learn can be viewed as either a general disposition or a situation-specific state” (Brophy, 2010, p. 12).

#### Citing a source with no page number(s)

If the work you are referencing does NOT contain page numbers, then use paragraph numbers, chapter numbers or section headings as part of the in-text reference.

> "As the national peak body for early childhood, ECA is a regular, and trusted, contributor to the public policy debate on all matters affecting young children (birth to eight years) and their families" (Early Childhood Australia, 2016, Advocacy section, para. 1).

#### Omitting words from a direct quote

If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots (. . .) and another space.

> Cannon (2012) argues that "changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas . . . will require coherent change strategies" (p. 165).

*Note: Quotes more than **40 words** in length need to be in **block** form – without using quotation marks, begin the quote on a new, indented line, and double-space the entire quote. At the end of the quote, include citation details such as author(s), year and page number(s) in brackets.*

>> The difference between intrinsic motivation and motivation to learn is closely related to the difference between affective and cognitive engagement experiences. Intrinsic motivation refers primarily to affective experience—enjoyment of the processes involved in engaging in an activity. In contrast, motivation to learn is primarily a cognitive experience involving attempts to make sense of the information that an activity conveys, to relate this information to prior knowledge, and to master the skills that the activity develops. (Brophy, 2010, p. 12)

### Multiple references in same parentheses

###### start-subtype-content

### Multiple works by the same author in the same year

###### start-subtype-content

When an author has published more than one cited work in the same year, distinguish each work by using a lower case letter after the year within the brackets (this is also written in the reference list).

**Paraphrasing in-text**

> According to Dean (2017a), it was found that . . .

> It is suggested that . . . (Dean, 2017b).

**Reference list**

Identify works by the same author(s) in the same year by the suffixes a, b, c, etc. after the year.

References by the same author(s) with the same publication year are arranged alphabetically by the title (excluding A or The) that follows the date.

> Dean, E. (2017a). Practice nursing: An action plan for a disparate workforce. *Nursing Standard*, 32(3), 25. https://doi.org/10.7748/ns.32.3.25.s24

> Dean, E. (2017b). Top nursing universities fall short in new ratings. *Nursing Standard*, 31(44), 9. https://doi.org/10.7748/ns.31.44.9.s8

&nbsp;
#### Lead authors are the same in the same year

If there are more than 3 authors and the lead author(s) are the same, but there are also different contributing authors then cite all authors until a distinction can be made followed by et al.

**Paraphrasing in-text**

> Arnaiz, Cochrane, Hastie, et al. (2018) state . . .

> Arnaiz, Cochrane, Calizaya, et al. (2018) argue . . .

**Reference list**

The reference list would include all authors.

### Secondary citation

###### start-subtype-content

A secondary citation is used when you acknowledge the work of an author that you have read about in another author’s work.

For example, if you read an article written by Hosany and Martin and they cite information from another study written by Heath and Scott, you would need to acknowledge Heath and Scott in the text:

> Heath and Scott (as cited in Hosany & Martin, 2012) claim that . . .

> Early research indicated . . . (Heath & Scott, as cited in Hosany & Martin, 2012).

In the reference list, you need to include the citation information for the Hosany and Martin article as that is where the Heath and Scott information was sourced:

> {.hanging-indent}Hosany, S., & Martin, D. (2012). Self-image congruence in consumer behavior. *Journal of Business Research*, 65(5), 685-691. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.03.015{/.hanging-indent}

### Personal communication

- emails

When citing in-text, include the author first name initial(s) followed by their family name, and a precise date of when the communication took place.

###### start-subtype-item

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

- A reference list is to be included at the end of your work acknowledging all sources used.

- The word 'References' should be on a new page, centred and in bold.

- The reference list is arranged alphabetically by author family name.

- If there are multiple entries by the same author, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.

- If there are several authors with the same family name, then arrange alphabetically by initials.

- Where an item has no author, it is cited by its title.

- The reference list must be double-spaced and each entry should have a hanging indent on the second and subsequent lines (if applicable).

- Italicise all book titles, journal titles, volume numbers, titles of newspapers and titles of webpages and websites.

#### Digital object identifier (DOI)
