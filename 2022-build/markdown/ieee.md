**Important**: This is a guide only. To avoid losing marks:

- Confirm the referencing requirements of your School with your lecturer, and

- Use [IEEE Reference Guide, Piscataway, NJ, USA: IEEE Periodicals, 2020](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE_Reference_Guide.pdf) to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.

The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) citation style is a **numbered** style where references are numbered [1], [2], [3] in-text and so on in the order of appearance in the body of the document. A **Reference List** at the end of the work provides full details of all references cited in-text. The references are ordered as they appear in the in-text references (in order of citation, not in alphabetical order). You need to follow this style when acknowledging your information sources.

### General rules for in-text citations

###### start-subtype-content

- In your writing, you must acknowledge each author or source of information (whether print or online) either by **paraphrasing** or using a direct quote.

- References that are cited in-text MUST appear as a number within square brackets, and need to come before any punctuation with a space before the bracket.

- Numbered references used in-text MUST start at [1] and continue in **ascending** order within the body of the work.
Once a source has been cited and allocated a reference number, the same reference number MUST be used throughout the body of a work if it’s referred to multiple times.

- Numbered citations may be treated grammatically as footnote numbers in the text e.g. As demonstrated by Smith [5] . . . OR, For further details, see [1], [5], [7].

- Numbered citations may also be treated as nouns in the text e.g. According to [7] . . . OR, As mentioned in [4], [5], [6]-[8] . . . (note the use of the **en dash** symbol ‘–’ between a source range).

- The **en-dash** symbol should be used between a source range e.g. [6]-[8]. The en-dash is wider than the hyphen and can be typed by holding down **Alt + 0150** on the numeric keypad.

- List all multiple citations in ascending numerical order e.g. [1], [5], [6]-[8] or as [1,5], [6-8].

- It is NOT necessary to mention either the author(s) or dates of any work cited in-text.

- If referring to authors in the body of the text, then all author family names must be listed up to **two** authors. If there are **three or more** authors, then cite only the family name of the first author followed by **et al.** for the first and subsequent citations.

- When directly quoting, that is using the exact words that an author has used, you must enclose the quote in double quotation marks “ ” and allocate a citation number along with the page number(s) in square brackets.

- In your writing, **acronyms** should be written out in full the first time referred to, followed by the acronym in parentheses. For subsequent occurrences, the use of the acronym is acceptable. See the **Abbreviations** section for more details.

#### Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words. When paraphrasing, it’s acceptable to include only the citation as a number in square brackets, or as a number along with the author’s family name as part of your sentence.

*Note: When paraphrasing, the citation details can be placed at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.*

#### Citation at the beginning

> Benson [1] states that thermal performance . . .

#### Citation in the middle

> . . . not only does the shift toward multicore processors mean more improvements in CPU speed [1], but they also consume less power and produce less heat.

#### Citation at the end

> . . . and therefore the rate of heat transfer slows [1].

*Note: Citations can also be structured according to whether they give prominence to the author, or to the information being conveyed.*

#### Author-prominent citations

> In his research on software thermal management, Benson [1] claims that . . .

#### Information-prominent citations

> . . . where more processors are being produced to optimise power and thermal performance [1].

#### Including page numbers in a paraphrase citation

When paraphrasing, page numbers are not usually used as part of the citation, unless it intends to help the reader to locate the source of the information in a lengthy or complex document.

*Note: Including page numbers when paraphrasing is optional, and is NOT a requirement of the IEEE referencing style.*

#### Direct quotes

Direct quotes are used when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between double quotation marks “ ” and add both the citation number followed by a comma, and the page number(s), preceded by **p**. (for a single page) or **pp**. (for multiple pages). **Do not overuse direct quotes!**

> "Due to the nonlinear nature of the Law of Dynamic Power, if the demand on the processor is light, the operating frequency can be reduced to save clock cycles, reducing power and limiting heat generation" [1, p. 82].

#### Citing a source with no page number(s)

If the work you are referencing does NOT contain page numbers, then use chapter numbers, section headings and paragraph numbers as part of the in-text reference.

> "Many physical dynamic systems can be represented and modeled by first-order differential equations" [1, Ch. 3, para. 1].

#### Omitting words from a direct quote

If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots ( . . . ) and another space.

> "The third basic electrical element is the inductor . . . Generally, the induced voltage v in an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of current i" [1, p. 168].

*Note: Quotes longer than **three lines** are strongly discouraged, and should be avoided.*

### Citing the same reference multiple times

###### start-subtype-content

If citing the same reference within the body of the text, then use the same citation number throughout the text. IEEE does NOT allow for the use of terms such as “ibid.” or “op. cit.” when citing the same reference multiple times. Instead, if the same source is cited multiple times, then it is preferable to distinguish between these with reference to the appropriate section, for example:

- [1, p. 15] when directly quoting a single page

- [1, pp. 29–31] directly quoting multiple pages

- [1, Ch. 8] referring to a chapter

- [1, Fig. 31] a figure

- [1, Sec. 6.5] a section

- [1, Tab. 12] a table

- [1, eq. (7)] an equation

- [1, Appendix IV] an appendix

- [1, Algorithm 9] an algorithm

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Multiple citations

###### start-subtype-content

If listing multiple citations within a sentence of text, then the preferred method is to list each citation number separately, or by inserting a **comma** or **en dash** between each number.

List all **multiple citations** in ascending numerical order e.g. [1], [6], [9]. Or [5-8].

> In [1], [4], [8] it was noted that . . .

> It is suggested by [6]-[9] that . . .

It is also acceptable for multiple citations to be listed the following way in-text:

> Recent studies [1, 2, 5] have noted that . . .

> Specific objectives [4-7] indicate that . . .

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Secondary citations

###### start-subtype-content

A secondary citation is used when you acknowledge the work of an author that you have read about in another author’s work.

The IEEE referencing style does **NOT** allow for the use of secondary citations.

If a secondary citation has to be used, then the original source MUST be located and cited.

If the original source cannot be located, then do NOT cite it.

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item



###### start-subtype-item

### Abbreviations

###### start-subtype-content

#### Month abbreviations

When citing journals, patents and websites, use the following abbreviations for months:

> Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., May, June, July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. (*note that some months appear in full and DO NOT require a full stop*).

Use a *forward slash* for bimonthly issues e.g. Apr./May 2016 and a en dash for a quarterly issue e.g. June–Aug. 2015.

#### Word abbreviations

Standard IEEE words when used in a reference should be abbreviated. See the **Useful Abbreviations in References** section of the [IEEE Reference Guide (2020)](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf) pp. 20–24.

#### Journal title abbreviations

If referencing any IEEE journal titles, then refer to the [IEEE Journal Titles and Reference Abbreviations (2018)](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Journal-Titles-and-Abbreviations.pdf) document.

#### Magazine title abbreviations

When referencing IEEE magazine titles, then refer to the [IEEE Magazine Titles and Reference Abbreviations (2018)](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Magazine-Titles-and-Abbreviations.pdf) document.

#### Conference proceeding abbreviations

When citing conference proceedings, the common rule is to list the author(s), title, name and location (if provided) of the conference and use any standard abbreviations where necessary. For further details, refer to the **Conferences and Conference Proceedings** section of the [IEEE Reference Guide (2020)](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf) p. 5.

#### Publisher abbreviations

For a list of some publisher abbreviations refer to the **List of Publishers** section of the [IEEE Reference Guide (2020)](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf) pp. 24–39.

#### Acronyms in-text

Acronyms are to be defined in-text and written out **in full the first time referred to**, followed by the acronym in parentheses.

> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [1] Space Flight report identifies . . .

For subsequent occurrences the use of the acronym is acceptable.

> The NASA [1] report also outlines . . .

#### Acronyms in the reference list

Acronyms in the reference list are to be written out in full for **corporate/organisation author names**. However, **publisher names** can be abbreviated or an acronym can be used.

> {.ieee-refs}[1] &nbsp; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, “Space flight: the first 30 years,” NASA, Washington, DC, USA, Rep. 1, 1991. {/.ieee-refs}

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

#### General rules

- Use a reference list to include all of the publications you have acknowledged at the end of your work, and use the heading **References** or **Reference List** on a new page.

- The reference list is arranged in an ascending numbered sequence such as [1], [2], [3] and so on, and MUST be presented in the order in which they appear in the body of the text.

- Reference list numbers should be positioned flush against the left page margin, and the citation details MUST appear on the same line, and be indented.

- IEEE requires some words, months, publisher names, conference proceedings and journal titles to be abbreviated where appropriate – see **Abbreviations** section for further details.

- **Publisher names** in the reference list can be abbreviated or an acronym can be used e.g. WHO may be used instead of World Health Organization.

- Do NOT abbreviate or use acronyms for **corporate/organisation author names** e.g. CSIRO should be written out as Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in the reference list.

- Capitalise and italicise titles where appropriate.

- Do NOT combine references – only one reference per number. See **Example of a reference list** section for formatting details.

- Include a retrieval statement in the form of a URL (where possible) if the reference is taken from an electronic or online source, or alternatively, where stated in the rules, a database name. There is **no** full stop after a URL, and the URL should not be hyperlinked.

- Take care when editing any references, as this may require careful renumbering of sources cited both in-text and in the reference list.

- The Reference List is to be formatted using 1.5 line spacing and single paragraph spacing between each citation. For clarification see your lecturer.

#### Digital object identifier (DOI)

When citing electronic sources such as e-journal articles or e-books, you ****MUST** include a digital object identifier (DOI) if stated. A DOI is a unique identifier that is assigned to certain electronic sources, and provides a persistent link to online content.

The DOI can be added to the reference list using the following formats:

> 1. doi:xx.xxxxxxxxxxxx.

> 2. http<nolink>://dx.doi.org/xxxxxxxxxxxxx.

> 3. https<nolink>://doi.org/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.

If no DOI is assigned, include either the journal/database homepage URL if taken from a library database, or the full URL if taken from a source on the open web.

*Note: A full stop should appear at the end of the DOI.*

#### Place of publication

For the place of publication, add the city, and then include the state code (if applicable) and country name, followed by the publisher and year of publication.

Cities in the USA need the city name, state abbreviation and country abbreviation.

> Boston, MA, USA: Cengage Learning, 2017.

Cities in the UK need the city name and country abbreviation.

> Oxford, U.K.: Newnes, 2012.

Cities in other countries (outside the USA and UK) just need to include the city name and country.

> Carlton South, Australia: Melbourne University Press, 1991.
