#### Introduction to Harvard

**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

-Confirm referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer

-Use Snooks & Co 2002, [Style manual for authors, editors and printers](https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/1adn3cm/alma9911447940001341), 6th edn, John Wiley & Sons, Milton QLD. to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.
Harvard is an author-date referencing style.

Harvard style requires in-text references and the reference list.

**In-text references** appear within the body of the document. They include the author(s) family name and the year of publication, with extra details if required, such as page numbers.

**A reference list** provides full details of all in-text references at the end of the document.

### General rules for in-text references

###### start-subtype-content

#### General rules for in-text references

- Use in-text references to acknowledge each author or source of information (print or online) used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.
- In-text reference details include the author(s) family name (or company or organisation name, if the author is a company or organisation) and year of publication, with extra information if required, such as page numbers.
- An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.  If the author is integrated as part of the sentence, only the date (and page number for direct quote) is in parentheses immediately after the author's name.
- Use an ampersand (&amp;) when listing authors in parentheses. For example: (Lewis &amp; Lewis 2015). Use the full word 'and' when mentioning an author(s) in a sentence. For example: Lewis and Lewis (2015) ... .
- When a work has two or three authors, always list all author(s) names every time the reference occurs in the text.
- When a work has four or more authors, list the first author(s) name followed by et al. For example: Haslam et al. (2013) ... or (Haslam et al. 2013).
- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.
- If the publication date of a reference is unknown, use n.d.
- If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text then use c. (meaning 'circa') before the year

&nbsp;
#### Direct quote

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s).

Do not overuse direct quotes.

Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number.

If no page number is available, include the location of the quote using a paragraph number or section heading. Abbreviate the word paragraph to para. with a period afterward.

If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots (...) and another space. For example: Cannon (2012, p. 165) argues that 'changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas ... will require coherent change strategies'.

An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

>> Cannon (2012, p. 165) argues that 'changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas as hazard reduction, resource use, waste, pollution, etc. will require coherent change strategies'.

##### Middle of a sentence

>> In a post about the emotions involved in undertaking a literature review, the Thesis Whisper (2013, para. 16) notes that 'elation when you realise you know more than your supervisor about your topic and you feel brave enough to argue about it' is one of the top five PhD emotions.

##### End of a sentence

>> 'Results broadly apply to managers in the tourism, hospitality, and service industries' (Hosany &amp; Martin 2012, Managerial implications section).

&nbsp;
#### Block quotations

Quotes of more than 30 words in length are known as block quotations.

Block quotes need to start on a new line, be indented from the text margin and set in smaller text size without single inverted commas (quotation marks).

At the end of the quote, include the reference details such as author name, year and page number(s) in parentheses.

> Khoo's PhD research project in the area of architecture investigated:

>>the application of alternative multifunctional material systems with possible form-changing and responsive capacities. These are integrated with physical computational processes for responsive morphing architectural design as an ‘integrated’ and ‘synergetic’ entity identical to single moulded devices such as the solid-state door handles developed by the automobile industry (2013, p. 10).

##### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

>> Ahmadjian (2006) noted that there has been disagreement over the influence of Japanese business groups on the economy.

##### Middle of a sentence

>> Based on the novel of the same name, <em>Coco Chanel &amp; Igor Stravinsky</em> (2010) follows the relationship between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky.

##### End of a sentence

>> The City of Melbourne's population increased by 10.5 percent in the period between July 2012 and June 2013 (Martin 2014).

###### end-subtype-content


### Multiple works by the same author(s) in the same year

###### start-subtype-content

#### Multiple works by the same author(s) in the same year

Identify works by the same author in the same year by adding letters a, b, c, and so forth, to the year in both the in-text reference and the reference list entry.

##### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

>>Jamison (1991a, 1991b) provides chiropractic information for diagnosing and health promotion.

##### Reference list entry

In the reference list, identify works by the same author(s) in the same year by adding letters a, b, c, and so forth to the year (for example: 1991a).

Try to identify the sequence in which the works were published. If the sequence cannot be determined, put the references in alphabetical order by title.

>> Jamison, JR 1991a, Diagnostic decision making in clinical practice, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD.

>> Jamison, JR 1991b, Health promotion for chiropractic practice, Aspen, Gaithersburg, MD.

###### end-subtype-content


### Works by different first authors with the same family name

###### start-subtype-content

#### Referencing Works by different first authors with the same family name

In a single document, to identify works by different first authors with the same family name insert the initials of the first author’s given name(s).

>>It is argued that ... (Fitzgerald, B 2010) but A. Fitzgerald and Eliades (2015) claim that ... .

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, order works by different first authors with the same family name by the year of publication.

>> Fitzgerald, A & Eliades, D 2015, Introduction to property law, Thomson Reuters, Pyrmont, NSW.

>> Fitzgerald, B 2010, 'Creative commons', Telecommunication Journal of Australia, vol. 60, no. 4, pp. 63.1-63.18.

###### end-subtype-content


### Multiple references in same parentheses

###### start-subtype-content

#### Multiple references in the same parentheses

When including two or more references in the same parentheses in a sentence, list all references alphabetically, separated by a semi-colon (;).

>>It has been claimed that… (Carroll 2012; Chalkley et al. 2012; Kuratko, Goldsby & Hornsby 2012).

###### end-subtype-content


### Personal communication

###### start-subtype-content

#### Personal communication

Include personal communication, such as face-to-face interviews, conversations, telephone calls, letters or emails, in an in-text reference.

Information about personal communication must be included in the in-text reference. Include the type of personal communication (for example: personal conversation, email, interview, telephone conversation) and the date in a date-month-year format.

Personal conversation can be abbreviated to pers. conv. and a telephone conversation can be abbreviated to tel. conv.

However, personal communication references **do not** need to be included in the reference list.

>> My field placement supervisor commented ‘… ‘ (CM Burns 2014, pers. conv., 20 April).

>> Ms Merrick (Melville Shire Council CEO) confirmed the details by email on 25 April 2014.

###### end-subtype-content


### Secondary citation

###### start-subtype-content

#### Secondary citation

Use a secondary citation to acknowledge the work of an author(s) that has been directly quoted or paraphrased in another author(s) work.

In the in-text reference, include the original source of information and the source you have used. For example, if an article by Hosany and Martin cites Heath and Scott, refer to both Heath & Scott and Hosany & Martin.

>> Early research indicated... (Heath & Scott, cited in Hosany & Martin 2012).

>> Heath and Scott (cited in Hosany & Martin 2012) claim that...

In the reference list, include only the source you have used. In this example, you would only need to include the Hosany and Martin reference.

>> Hosany, S & Martin, D 2012, ‘Self-image congruence in consumer behavior’, Journal of Business Research, vol. 65, no. 5, pp. 685-691.

###### end-subtype-content


### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

#### General rules for the reference list

- Use a reference list at the end of the document to include the publication details of all the in-text references within your writing.

- Start a reference list on a new page using the heading **References** or **Reference List**.

- List only references included in your writing.

- If your lecturer/teacher or supervisor has also requested a bibliography, list any other sources that you have read but not included in your writing under a heading of Bibliography.

- If there are multiple entries by the same author, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.

- If there are several authors with the same family name, then arrange alphabetically by initials.

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If the publication date of a reference is unknown, use n.d.

- If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text then use c. (meaning 'circa') before the year.

&nbsp;
#### Place of publication

If there is no place of publication use n.p. (for ‘no place’).

If the place of publication is not commonly known (for example: Harlow) or the place of publication could be located in two or more countries, additional information is required.

For Australia and the United States, add the abbreviated name of the State.

>> Fitzroy, VIC or Delmar, NY

For the United Kingdom, add the abbreviation UK.

>> Harlow, UK

For other countries, add the name of the country.
