## Introduction to Harvard

**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

- Confirm referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer
- Use Snooks & Co 2002, Style manual for authors, editors and printers, 6th edn, John Wiley & Sons, Milton QLD. to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.

Harvard is an author-date referencing style.

Harvard style requires in-text references and the reference list.
<div class="special-class" markdown="1">
**In-text references** appear within the body of the document. They include the author(s) family name and the year of publication, with extra details if required, such as page numbers.
</div>
**A reference list** provides full details of all in-text references at the end of the document.
